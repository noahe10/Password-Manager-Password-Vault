# Password-Manager-Password-Vault

Created a web-based password manager application using Python/Django and HTML/CSS. Implemented CRUD functionality, a search bar for locating specific passwords, and a login/register screen

### Login/Register
I'm using the Login Mixin to create the login screen. In the event you not have an account, you can register for one.
