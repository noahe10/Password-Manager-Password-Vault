# Password-Manager-Password-Vault

Created a web-based password manager application using Python/Django and HTML/CSS. Implemented CRUD functionality, a search bar for locating specific passwords, and a login/register screen

### Sections
[Login/Register]([#-login/register)

### Login/Register
This is the login screen. In the event you not have an account, you can register for one.
The register form will ask for a user to create a username and a password with special characters. Once you're done making an account you can login and begin storing passwords!

### Homepage
Users will be introduced to this screen when they first create their account. Right now it is blank but once they start adding passwords to the manager, they can see simple information like
what site/application uses the password, the length of the passwords, and a link to be able to view the password without any barriers blocking the user.

The homepage also has a search feature in the event a user needs to quickly search for a specific password and its information.
